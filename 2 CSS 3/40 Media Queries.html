  -> Media query is a CSS technique introduced in CSS3.
        It uses the @media rule to include a block of CSS properties only if a certain condition 
        is true.
  -> Media queries allow you to apply CSS styles depending on a device's general type (such as
     print vs. screen) or other characteristics such as screen resolution/size or 
     browser viewport width.
